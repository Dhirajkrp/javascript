# Random Recipe Generator:

- This project gives a small example of how we can use the open API's in our project.
- For this project i used `themealdb` api , which provides an functionality for generating random meals everytime.
- This also provides use with the ingredients list, description of the meal , an image for the meal as well as the youtube video.
- This is a great way to get started with working with API. :)
